# VoxElectra

**VoxElectra** is an advanced project developed for SOC 2024 ("Summer of Code"). The project dives deep into the realms of audio data processing, encompassing sentiment analysis of text, speech recognition, and an in-depth exploration of sound concepts. Through a series of well-documented Jupyter Notebooks, this repository offers practical implementations and insights into modern techniques for working with audio data.

## Project Overview

1. **Assignment_01.ipynb**: This notebook presents a machine learning model designed to predict the sentiment of movie reviews. Whether a review is positive or negative is determined using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, showcasing the application of sentiment analysis in real-world scenarios.

2. **Assignment_02.ipynb**: Inspired by TensorFlowâ€™s mini speech recognition tutorial, this notebook demonstrates the creation of a model that classifies short spoken commands. This assignment highlights key concepts in speech processing and the use of neural networks for command recognition.

3. **VoxElectra.ipynb**: The centerpiece of this repository, VoxElectra, is a robust and scalable speech-to-text conversion model. This notebook delves into the architecture and methodologies employed to accurately transcribe spoken language into text, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications, from virtual assistants to transcription services.

4. **Understanding_Sound.ipynb**: A comprehensive exploration of sound, this notebook covers the fundamental concepts of sound waves, their properties, and how they can be analyzed and manipulated. It serves as a primer for those new to audio data processing or anyone looking to solidify their understanding of sound science.

5. **Resources.txt**: A curated list of resources that were instrumental in the development of this project. This file includes references to articles, tutorials, and documentation that guided the learning and implementation process.
